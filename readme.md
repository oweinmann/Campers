I’d like to purchase an off-road caravan in Australia and need to gather as much information as possible. I’d like you to create a file to use for generating this information. To start with, lets include the following information in this file, however we’ll be refining this as we go:
 Requirements for the caravan to be included:
 - must be new, not used  - minimum length 15 foot  - maximum length 18 foot  - maximum price $100,000 AUD
 - must have at least 2 bunk beds for children
 - no hybrid roof, must be a hard top

Specifications which should be included in a comparison table:
 - Make and model
 - Dimensions
 - Weight
 - Single or twin axle
 - Size/capacity of solar panels
 - Size/capacity of batteries
 - Size of main bed
 - Price
