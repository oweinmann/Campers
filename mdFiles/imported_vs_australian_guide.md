## Financial Analysis

### Example: $90,000 Australian vs $60,000 Imported

**Initial Outlay:**
- Australian: $90,000 + $5,000 accessories = $95,000
- Imported: $60,000 + $15,000 accessories/upgrades = $75,000
- **Savings: $20,000**

**After 5 Years (assuming 15% annual depreciation):**
- Australian: Resale ~$45,000 (50% retained)
- Imported: Resale ~$21,000 (35% retained)
- **Australian retains $24,000 more value**

**Net Position After 5 Years:**
- Australian: $95,000 - $45,000 = $50,000 cost
- Imported: $75,000 - $21,000 = $54,000 cost
- **Similar net cost, but Australian had better features during ownership**

**The Verdict:**
Over 5+ years, costs can be similar. Decision factors:
- Quality and features during ownership
- Reliability and maintenance costs
- Support availability when needed
- Peace of mind value
