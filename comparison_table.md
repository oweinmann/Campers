## Notes and Considerations

### Weight Considerations
- Ensure tow vehicle is rated for ATM
- Ball weight should be 10-15% of ATM for stability
- Consider upgrading tow vehicle suspension if needed

### Solar and Battery
- 300W+ solar recommended for off-grid camping
- Lithium batteries more expensive but lighter and longer-lasting
- AGM batteries cheaper but heavier

### Axle Configuration
- **Single axle**: Lighter, better fuel economy, more maneuverable off-road
- **Twin axle**: More stable on highway, better weight distribution, redundancy

### Bed Configurations
- Verify bunk weight ratings for children's ages
- Check if bunks can convert to storage or additional living space
- Ensure main bed is comfortable (minimum Queen size preferred)

### Budget Items Beyond Purchase Price
- Registration and insurance
- Towing equipment (hitch, brake controller, mirrors)
- Camping accessories (annexe, solar upgrade, etc.)
- Delivery/transport costs
