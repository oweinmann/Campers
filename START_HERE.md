## Important Notes

### ⚠️ Models to Avoid:

### 💡 Key Research Tips:
1. Always ask if the layout includes bunks - not all models do
2. Confirm hard top (many off-road models are hybrid)
3. Get the ATM weight - ensure your tow vehicle can handle it
4. Solar/battery upgrades often worthwhile
5. Attend caravan shows for promotions and side-by-side comparison
6. Join Facebook groups for specific brands before buying

### 📍 Caravan Shows (Best Time to Buy):
- Sydney Caravan & Camping Show
- Melbourne Leisurefest
- Brisbane Caravan, Camping & Touring Supershow
- Perth Caravan & Camping Show

**Show benefits:** Promotional pricing, compare multiple brands, special deals
