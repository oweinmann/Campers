## Important Terminology

### Weight Ratings
- **Tare Weight**: Empty weight of caravan (no water, gas, supplies)
- **ATM (Aggregate Trailer Mass)**: Maximum total weight the caravan can be (fully loaded)
- **Ball Weight**: Downward force on tow ball (typically 10-15% of ATM)
- **Payload**: ATM minus Tare (how much you can load)

### Off-Road Features
- **Independent suspension**: Each wheel moves independently for better off-road handling
- **DO35/DO45**: Popular Australian off-road coupling system
- **Checker plate**: Diamond-pattern protective metal sheeting
- **Galvanized chassis**: Rust-resistant steel frame

### Solar and Electrical
- **Ah (Amp hours)**: Battery capacity measurement
- **AGM**: Absorbed Glass Mat battery (cheaper, heavier)
- **Lithium (LiFePO4)**: Lighter, longer life, more expensive
- **MPPT**: Maximum Power Point Tracking (efficient solar controller)
- **Inverter**: Converts 12V DC to 240V AC for appliances
