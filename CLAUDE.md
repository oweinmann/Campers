## Project Overview

This is a research project for purchasing an off-road caravan in Australia. The goal is to gather comprehensive information about caravans that meet specific requirements and create comparison tables to aid in decision-making.

## Caravan Requirements

All caravans researched must meet the following criteria:
- **Condition**: New only (not used)
- **Length**: Minimum 15 feet, maximum 18 feet
- **Price**: Maximum $100,000 AUD
- **Sleeping**: At least 2 bunk beds for children
- **Roof**: Hard top only (no hybrid roofs)

## Comparison Specifications

When gathering information about caravans, include these specifications:
- Make and model
- Dimensions (length, width, height)
- Weight (Tare, ATM, ball weight)
- Axle configuration (single or twin axle)
- Solar panel size/capacity
- Battery size/capacity
- Main bed dimensions
- Price

## Project Structure

The repository currently contains:
- `readme.md` - Original project requirements and specifications
- Future files will likely include comparison tables, research notes, and caravan data

## Working with This Project

When assisting with this project:
1. Focus on Australian off-road caravan manufacturers and dealers
2. Ensure all recommendations strictly meet the stated requirements
3. Present data in structured formats (tables, CSV, or markdown) for easy comparison
4. Include source URLs or dealer information when gathering specifications
5. Be aware of Australian caravan terminology (e.g., ATM = Aggregate Trailer Mass, Tare weight, ball weight)
